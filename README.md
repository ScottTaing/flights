Analyzing the flights data set from hack reduce

This project is a collection of scripts to present various statistics on https://github.com/hackreduce/Hackathon specifically https://github.com/hackreduce/Hackathon/tree/master/datasets/flights
The intent of the project is to take this data and calculate the mean, media, variance and standard deviation from the flight data and then plot it on a graph.

This will help a user to look into the past data and visualize the trends from the past that can help him predict a future model.
